(Under the agreement, Amtrak committed to complying with the ADA and making intercity rail stations accessible.)</p><p>Amtrak must also include a status report on ADA compliance at Amtrak-served stations (based on a station assessment by Amtrak or the party responsible for ADA compliance). &nbsp;A station assessment means a review of all components of a station, including the building, platform, path to train, and parking areas, as required by the U.S. Access Board. For those Amtrak-served stations where Amtrak is not responsible for ADA compliance, Amtrak must include in the report information on the responsible party.</p>"
